<h4><b>Additional notes on target turnaround times:</b></h4>

* Troponin and Lactate WB:
    + All labs are treated as stat regardless of documented priority and patient setting.
    + Ambulatory labs excluded from turnaround time analysis
* Rapid Flu:
    + All labs are treated as stat regardless of documented priority and patient setting.
* C. diff:
    + All labs are treated as stat regardless of documented priority and patient setting.
    + Turnaround time for ambulatory C. diff tests are not tracked but rather volume of these labs is monitored.

<h4><b>Turnaround Time Exclusions</b></h4>

Turnaround time analysis excludes labs with out of order steps (ie, collect after receive), missing timestamps, add-on orders, and labs not originating in IP, ED, or ambulatory settings (ie, Outreach).

<br>
  
<h4><b>Add On Orders</b></h4>
Add on orders are defined as labs with an order time more than 5 minutes after receive time. These labs are excluded from turnaround time analysis but the volume of these labs is monitored.

<br>

<h4><b>Missing Collections</b></h4>
Labs are classified as missing collections based on the following criteria:

* SCC: Collection time equal to receive time
* Sunquest: Collection time equal to order time

### Anatomic Pathology
<h4><b>Target Turnaround Times</b></h4>
The table below summarizes target turnaround times for Anatomic Pathology as agreed upon by clinical and operational leadership.

<h4><b>Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for GI Specimens</b></h4>

<br>
Only the codes for GI biopsies are included in the analysis.

<h4><b>Additional notes on target turnaround times:</b></h4>

* Receive to Result TAT: for anatomic pathology this metric only includes MSHS business days and is a measure of internal laboratory performance.

* Collect to Result TAT: for anatomic pathology this metric includes all calendar days and is a patient-centric measure of performance.

* At this phase, target turnaround times for collect to result have not been established. This metric will be tracked in order to understand current performance and establish future targets.

* Primary Specimens: When a specimen has multiple slides, only the first slide is included. The primary slide is identified as those with spec_sort_order = A.

* All Breast Specimens:
    + Included all the primary breast specimens only. 
    + Only labs from ambulatory and inpatient services with valid time stamps included in TAT calculations.
    + TAT analysis excludes labs with missing timestamps
    + All settings included in the resulted volume
    
* GI Biopsies:
    + Included only the samples that are consisted of GI biopsies
    + Only primary specimen GI biopsies included
    + Only labs from ambulatory and inpatient services with valid time stamps included in TAT calculations.
    + TAT analysis excludes labs with missing timestamps
    + All settings included in the resulted volume

* Cyto Gyn:
    + TAT and volume analysis were only calculated for Cyto Gyn specimens that were finalized and closed out in EPIC
    + Included all primary Cyto Gyn specimens
    + Only labs from ambulatory and inpatient services with valid time stamps included in TAT calculations.
    + TAT analysis excludes labs with missing timestamps
    + All settings included in the resulted volume

* Cyto Non-Gyn:
    + TAT and volume analysis were only calculated for Cyto non-Gyn specimens that were finalized and closed out in EPIC
    + Included all primary Cyto non-Gyn specimens
    + Only labs from ambulatory and inpatient services with valid time stamps included in TAT calculations.
    + TAT analysis excludes labs with missing timestamps
    + All settings included in the resulted volume

* Backlog Cases:
    + Backlog cases are defined as all the cases that are open by cytology and microbiology.
